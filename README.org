* the gist

  emacs-ng has denojs. you have cljs. denojs wants ecmascript modules. shadow-cljs allows you to emit cljs as ecmascript modules: here is an incredibly boring example how!
* steps
  (implicit step of being a self conscious sentient being with agency and capacity to communicate)
** 1. get clojure

   I defer to: [https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started]
** 2. yoink this repo
** 3. cd into the directory you pulled this repo and run

   #+begin_src shell
   clojure -M:cljs watch app
   #+end_src

   This will start a file watcher that will re-emit your cljs upon each save.
** open boring.js

   i.e.

   #+begin_src elisp
(find-file "./boring.js")
   #+end_src
** figure out the directory of where you put the folder containing this very file

   i.e.

   #+begin_src elisp
(pwd)
   #+end_src
** set that directory to the path variable in boring.js
** then run `eval-js-buffer`
** run through the streets chanting 'I did it'
